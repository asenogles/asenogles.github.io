After a recent trip to Christchurch, New Zealand in December 2019 to collect lidar data before and after <a href="https://www.eqc.govt.nz/assets/Publications-Resources/What-is-blast-induced-liquefaction-testing-Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">blast-induced</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction" target="_blank">liquefaction</a> testing. I created a web visualization of the data using <a href="https://github.com/potree/potree" target="_blank">potree</a>.
