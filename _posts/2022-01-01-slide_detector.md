I designed, developed, built, and deployed a network of real-time RTK-GNSS sensors for monitoring two landslides on the Oregon Coast. A demo, which includes access to real-time data over the previous 24 hours is available at the <a href="https://southcoastslides.web.app/" target="_blank">following webpage</a>.
