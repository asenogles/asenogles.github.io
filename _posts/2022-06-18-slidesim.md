 I have recently been working on a new approach to measuring spatially dense 3D landslide displacement using <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html#:~:text=Lidar%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Light,variable%20distances)%20to%20the%20Earth." target="_blank">lidar</a> <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-digital-elevation-model-dem" target="_blank">DEMs</a>. By using <a href="../slidepy" target="_blank">simulation powered</a> self-supervised learning, we can train a site specific optical flow predictor capable of accurately computing the dense 2D horizontal displacement. The vertical component of displacement can then be computed via a remapping technique. Overall, this method (SlideSim) produces significantly improved accuracies compared to existing methods.
