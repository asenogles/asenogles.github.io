I recently collected lidar data at the Hooskanaden landslide following a surge of up to 45 meters! You can check out a visualization of terrestrial and UAS lidar of the landslide built using potree <a href="https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/geomatics/projects/OregonCoast/Hooskanaden/Feb2019/lidar/" target="_blank">here</a>.
