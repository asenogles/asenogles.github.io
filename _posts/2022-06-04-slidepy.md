I developed a fast, multithreaded python library for performing 3D landslide modelling and simulation. This was developed as part of my <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14112644" target="_blank">recent work</a> to train <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow" target="_blank">optical flow</a> predictors for landslide change detection using simulation powered <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/" target="_blank">self-supervised</a> learning. However, the library could also potentially be used for modelling or back analysis of landslides.
