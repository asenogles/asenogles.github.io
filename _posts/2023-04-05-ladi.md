Landslides are a 4D problem varying across both space and time. At the present landslide monitoring solutions provide either high-spatial resolution data (such as <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/remotesensing.html" target="_blank">remote-sensing</a> methods), or high-temporal resolution data (such as in-situ monitoring data). I developed <a href="https://github.com/asenogles/ladi" target="_blank">LADI</a> (**LA**ndslide **D**isplacement **I**nterpolation) as a method of performing high-spatial, high-temporal data fusion of remote-sensing and in-situ monitoring data. LADI has been further developed into an open-source python library capable of fast multithreaded operation.
