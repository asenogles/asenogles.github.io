Like all scientists, those in the geospatial realm put a lot of work into writing papers. While academic papers are great for presenting ideas, their 2D nature is not ideal for presenting geospatial data, particularly dense 3D lidar pointcloud data. To overcome this, on a recent research project for the Oregon Department of Transportation, I created <a href="https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/geomatics/projects/rockfall/spr-809/digital-appendix/" target="_blank">this digital appendix webpage</a>. The digital appendix contains some background about the project, as well as an easily accessible web visualization (using potree) of the processed and classified pointclouds that were produced on the project.
